    The application is completely based on open-source-components and combines GeoInformation e.g. from OpenstreetMap (OSM) with voluminous filtering functions and a report generator. It combines qooxdoo with OpenLayers and BIRT. The backend is a Java servlet running on a Tomcat server. It can be used with different databases, e.g. Firebird, Postgres, Oracle or Microsoft SQL Server.
