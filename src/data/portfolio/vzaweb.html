    <h2>VZAweb: web-based traffic census data base</h2>
    <p>For various purposes and in different intervals cities and communes carry out traffic counts. This often causes extensive data collections with data from various sources. Mostly the data is archived in digitally using directory names with a strict directory structure or even in paper form using folders. In addition, they are often accessible only to a limited number of users.

Surveys from different sources and time periods can be compared, developments analysed, and traffic loads displayed.

    The application is completely based on open-source-components and combines GeoInformation e.g. from OpenstreetMap (OSM) with voluminous filtering functions and a report generator. It combines qooxdoo with OpenLayers and BIRT. The backend is a Java servlet running on a Tomcat server. It can be used with different databases, e.g. Firebird, Postgres, Oracle or Microsoft SQL Server.
